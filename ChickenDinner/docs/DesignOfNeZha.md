# Design Note of Nezha
## 1.Introduction
There are two forms, one is a large form, the other is a small form, and the initial form is a small form. When a certain condition is reached, it becomes a large form. When a large form reaches a certain condition, it will change back to a small form. The specific conditions will be described in detail later.
## 2. Small Form
### (1) Initial Values
There are three initial values ​​for small forms: stomach/brain/heart.

1. The value of the stomach is consistent with the normal role, the rate of decrease is lower than the normal role, and the way and value of the increase are consistent with the normal role.

2. The brain value is consistent with the normal role, the rate of decrease is higher than the normal character, and the added mode and value are consistent with the normal role.

3. The heart value is higher than the normal character, only the injury can be reduced. It is consistent with the normal role, and the added mode and value are consistent with the normal role.

4. The moving speed is the same as the normal character.

5. The defense value is the same as the normal role.

### (2) Attack value
Because all characters in the empty hand state can not attack.

The value is the same as the normal character when the game is set up with tools such as axe/shovel.

### (3)Specific Attributes
1. Fire resistance: normal characters lose their heart values ​​in a fire (such as igniting a forest in a forest), and no one will

2. Resilience: When the heart value of Nezha is less than 5%, it will return to 20%, but only once.

3. On the full moon night (that is, the day the pig is transformed), it will become a big form. All data is carried out according to the big form.


## 3, Large Form
### (1). Initial Values
1. The value of the stomach is consistent with the normal role, the rate of decrease is higher than the normal character, and the way and value of the increase are consistent with the normal role.

2. The brain value is lower than the normal character, the reduction rate is higher than the normal character, and the added mode and value are consistent with the normal role.

3. The heart value is higher than the normal character, only the injury can be reduced. It is consistent with the normal role, and the added mode and value are consistent with the normal role.

4. The moving speed is higher than the normal character.

5. The defense value is consistent with the normal role.

### (2). Specific Attributes
1. Deceptive: consistent with small form

2. Fire resistance: consistent with small form

3. Resilience: consistent with small form

4. Aggressiveness: The attack value is twice the size of the small form.

5. Brain residual: The brain value decreases with time and the rate of decrease is 3 times that of small form.

## 4, Transformation
Small Nezha will transform into big form on the full moon night, or when his sanity value is lower than 60%.

## 5, Featured Items/Weapons

### Qiankun Ring 
A golden ring, on which body is slanting.

Function: Increase brain data, and increase it by 20%. Normal characters will get brain data recovery through sputum and other methods. Do not wear Qiankun circle, recovery and positive
The constant value is the same, and it will be restored a little/once. It can't attack.

### Fire spear
Attacking the object at close range, holding it in your hand, the attack power is 5 times that of the hammer. You can't attack the trees, you can only attack the creatures.

### The Red Armillary Sash
An armor to enhance defense.
